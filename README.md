Project SER316

Description
Skul is a teacher course planning program that was designed using legacy code from the program Memoranda.

((Dr. Mehlhase:
This is mostly a calendar and UI topic. It does not have too many back-end things and the focus should be on visualizing things well. You should think of a way to save the data so you can give me sample data with your project. I advise you to use JSON for this.))

TODO: (required)

1. Should be able to include all the main information about a course like (Start date,
End date, holidays, free days, lecture times, final exam, breaks)

2. Should be able to specify how many assignments the course has, the tool should try to place them in a good way (user should be able to change the dates and specify
what day of the week they should be due)

3. Should be able to set main topics for lecture days

4. Should be able to set how many sprints are planned and how long they are supposed to be
 4.1. the tool should then try to place them in a good way with at least 4 days in between for the transition period
 4.2. the lecturer should still be able to move the dates

5. instructors can include due dates for themselves (eg. have kickoff document ready, which are not visible to anyone else but the instructor)

6. instructors can set due dates for their TAs and graders

7. dates can be made visible for students if the instructor chooses to do so

8. instructor should be able to switch between different courses

9. should be able to include todo lists for themselves, TAs and students

10. should be able to include documents that might be relevant

=======================================================
Information about Memoranda:

The purpose of this project is to enhance the Memoranda application.

Memoranda is a project that has largely been dormant since 2007, so why are we using it? This codebase has been used in the past, it is of sufficient size and scope to challenge your skills in understanding a complete application (it has somewhere in the neighborhood of 25k lines of code). It also has features that just about anyone who has ever used a calendaring application can understand.

In the docs directory is an initial set of analysis models - class diagrams and sequence diagrams in UML, that a previous team did as part of their solution process. These were included only in the event that you may want to use these as a head start on your design and implementation work. You are absolutely not required to use or implement anything in the analysis document!

Your first step should be to clone the github repository (easiest way is to clone directly into your Eclipse Workspace folder). You can watch the short video on how to clone and run Memoranda: on Canvas under Memoranda in the project module.

You should then be able to run the project. The included Gradle script and Wrapper should work. You should be able to use "gradle run" in the command line to run Memoranda through Gradle. In due course you will need to add things to the Gradle file (eg. add Unit Test).

Start of with changing little things to get to know Memoranda (before the project starts).

After that go back to the initial version and start your SCRUM process and document all changes through GitHub and Taiga (like I said, if it isnâ€™t in GitHub/taiga it does not count).

Good luck and have fun!
